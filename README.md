I’m a final-year engineering student at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/), majoring in [Data Science & Decision](https://supaerodatascience.github.io) with a minor in **Energy & Environment**, after completing an exchange semester at **EPFL**.  


My work and studies are driven by two main interests:  
- using **data and optimization** to tackle complex systems and problem,  
- supporting the energy transition through **modeling and decision tools**.  

I am currently looking for a **5–6 month end-of-study internship starting April 2026**, ideally at the crossroads of **data and sustainable energy**.
