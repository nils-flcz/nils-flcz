I’m a final-year engineering student at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/), majoring in [**Data Science & Decision**](https://supaerodatascience.github.io) with a minor in **Energy & Environment**.  
I also had the chance to complete an exchange semester at **EPFL**.  

My work and studies are driven by two main passions:  
- leveraging **data, AI and optimization** to address complex systems,  
- contributing to the **energy transition** with modeling and decision-support tools.  

I’m currently looking for a **5–6 month end-of-study internship starting April 2026**, ideally at the crossroads of **data science and sustainable energy**.
